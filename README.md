# Overview

**NECS** (Nano ECS) is a single-header Entity-Component-System (ECS) library being developed for C++20. It is designed to be simple and easy to use, with a focus on cache friendliness.

## Foreword

Hello & thank you for checking out my repo! Let me know about any concerns or bugs regarding my code, I appreaciate any feedback and criticism you have.

If you want to give my library a go, keep in mind that this is a personal project serving my own development and needs as a programmer first, and that the project will change frequently as I expand my knowledge pool.

The workflow that NECS supports relies heavily on knowing exactly what the structure of your data is (no arbitrary archetype-switching or runtime types), which is how I prefer to approach design. A built-in entity hierarchy system is coming eventually to enable dynamic structures.

Currently, NECS supports smaller projects and single-threaded use only. Read: I haven't tested it enough yet.

## Features
- The library is a single header and can be dropped into any project.
- It uses the standard library only.
- Entity data is structured inside tuples and vectors, using an SoA approach & allowing for fast queries. This also allows for compile-time filtering with some template magic.
- Sleep system: entities are associated with a state and, in addition to their archetype storage, are located in one of two pools: living or sleeping. These are iterated through separately.
- Dead entities are not considered during iterations, but their ids (indices) are reused (an id-lock system is coming eventually that will allow for ids to be lifetime-unique).
- Pool memory only grows by default, with dead entities being swapped to the end to allow for reuse. Pools can be manually trimmed by using trim() to remove dead memory.
- User-defined events + several built-in ones to track changes to data.

# Getting started

## Requirements

- C++20

## Installation

Just drop the `necs.hpp` file into your include path and you are good to go!

```cpp
#include "necs.hpp"
```

## Example setup

```cpp
#include "necs.hpp"

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Components
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

struct Name
{
    std::string value;
};

struct Position
{
    size_t x;
    size_t y;
};

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Archetypes
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

using Monster = NECS::Entity<Position, Name>;

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Registry data
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

using Archetypes = NECS::Data<Monster>;
using Events = NECS::Data<>;
using Singletons = NECS::Data<>;
using Queries = NECS::Data<>;

NECS::Registry<Archetypes, Events, Singletons, Queries> registry;

int main()
{
    registry.populate(Monster(), 100);

    for (auto [id, data] : registry.iter<Monster, Name>())
    {
        auto& [name] = data;

        name.value = "New name";
    }

    return 0;
}
```
## Creating
```cpp
void create()
{   
    // Adds a single monster to the system
    registry.create(Monster());

    // Adds 100 monsters to the system, calls create under the hood
    registry.populate(Monster(), 100);
};
```

## Changing state
```cpp
void change()
{
    // Changes data after update is called
    registry.queue(0, NECS::KILL);
    registry.queue(1, NECS::SNOOZE);
    registry.update();

    // Changes data instantly
    registry.execute(1, NECS::WAKE);
    registry.execute(2, NECS::KILL);
    registry.execute(3, NECS::SNOOZE);
}
```

## Single access
```cpp
void access()
{   
    // VIEW returns nullopt if entity is dead or the type is incorrect
    auto [name0] = registry.view<Monster, Name>(0).value();

    // FIND filters and iterates over every archetype, returns a view
    auto [name1] = registry.find<Name>(1).value();

    // REF returns the entire entity related to this id
    auto [pos, name2] = registry.ref(2).get<Monster>();

    // GET panics if the type is incorrect or the entity is DEAD
    auto [name3] =  registry.get<Monster, Name>(3);
};
```

## Iteration
```cpp
void iterate()
{
    // One-time dynamic storage iterator, useful for iterating through a single archetype
    for (auto [id, data] : registry.iter<Monster, Name, Position>())
    {
        auto& [name, position] = data;

        name.value = "New name";
    } 

    // Templated, pre-configured queries that iterate through the whole system
    for (auto [id, data] : registry.query<PositionNameQuery>())
    {
        auto& [position, name] = data;

        name.value = "New name";
    }

    // Dynamic alternative to queries, filter and iterates
    registry.for_each<Position, Name>
    ([](NECS::EntityId id, NECS::Data<Position&, Name&> data) {
        auto& [position, name] = data;

        name.value = "New name";
    });
}
```
